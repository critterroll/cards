          </div>
          <h3><b> Great for beginners. The Lawnbird's power lets them inspect any place on the map when in an unlocked room. They do this by flying up to see the map through a bird’s eye view. 
           But since the Lawnbird is a ground bird that can fly for only a little bit, they must return to their original spot after inspecting. Stat-wise, the Lawnbird is very well-rounded. 
            It leans more toward offensive skills rather than passive. If you’re new but like to take risks, this may be the critter for you.</b></h3>

         <img src="Petrap.png" style="width:100%" alt="Petrap">
         </div>
          <h3><b> Small, but very durable, the Petrap is a very resilient critter. They're harder to beat than you think. They even waddle and scoot as a way to move. 
          It can even jump through very bizarre methods that probably break several laws of physics. It uses its mouth as a hand, and its tie as a handy tool. 
          While not very athletic or mobile, the Petrap can use its power to roll like a tumbling boulder and gain +4 on stamina. 
          This allows it to move further in distance rolls, which can come in a lot of handy when you’re trying to get from one place to another.</b></h3>

         </div>
          <h3><b>They wear masks for a bunch of reasons. These include fashion, culture, and protection from identity theft. Cats'n'Masks must be clever to outsmart their enemies. 
            Thanks to their training in martial arts, they can meditate and gain much necessary wisdom. Their power grants them +2 on Smarts, which helps in Inspections and talk encounters.
            And all three of their stats can be used for Stealthy encounters. If you desire to evade a 2nd round of an encounter, then be sure to take advantage of the cats' stats in Athleticism, Shield, and Stealth.</b></h3>

         <h3><b>These avian critters sadly can’t fly up to inspect the map like the Lawnbird. Hobravins hold a very different, but useful power. 
         Thanks to its big brain that happens to be larger than its torso, the Hobravin can use its mind and power to create health potions that raise 3 HP.
         They also have high Smarts and Crafting, which can be great for finding and making Items respectively. </b>h3></h3>b>

          <img src="Alanite.png" style="width:100%" alt="Alanite">
          <h3><b>Alanites get their name from the Alacorn (a winged unicorn) and a chess knight. They also happen to be servants of a guy named Alan, but he’s been out of the picture for a while. 
          Like the Petrap, the Alanite don’t have any arms or legs. But their wings grant them decent mobility. Additionally, their power grants them a finite form of telekinesis, which can move any object or critter from one room to another. 
          There is nothing you can do to stop them when you’re being moved. </b></h3>

          <img src="Snow Growl.png" style="width:100%" alt="Growl">
        </div>
          <h3><b>Growls are ultimately a giant stuffed bear, but they prefer the term "Plush Golem." They can stare into the eyes of any adjacent player and put them to sleep, resulting in a lost turn for the victim. 
          This power can only be done to one player at a time. This can also be used for NPCs made by the game’s narrator. So it doesn't necessarily have to be a jerk move. <br>
          The Snow Growl has a tendency to bury its sleeping victims in the ground. Even on hard floors, it finds a way (whether by covering the body with magazines or garbage). 
          This means that while their victims are asleep, nothing can be done to harm the player during the lost turn EVER.</b></h3>

          <h3><b>They must be cunning and quick to survive. Always be on the move and ready to work yourself out of a tricky situation. Their sugar rush power gives them one advantage. 
          After finishing a turn, the Chewbunny can exit the room they’re in to go to an adjacent space — as long as it's unlocked. 
          Even if you've already rolled for distance, this power lets your critter move again, making the Chewbunny a great asset in stealth missions. </b></h3>

        <div class="column1">
          <img src="Chiplin.png" style="width:100%" alt="Chiplin">
          Chiplins are a hybrid of Gremlins and Chipmunks. Their power allows them to steal Item Cards, which is a move that NO ONE ELSE CAN DO. This may seem like an overpowered move. 
          But thankfully, they can only perform this act when unseen. They’ll have high stats in Stealth, so be sure to save this power and use it during a stealthful Action, Encounter, or Distance Roll. 
          Be sneaky and clever, and even the most powerful critters won’t see you coming.
